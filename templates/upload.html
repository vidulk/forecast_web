                        Based on the data you provide, a combined statistical & Machine Learning model is trained to forecast the future values of your data.
                        This model is then used to generate a forecast for the next <code>steps</code> ahead.
                        
                        We automatically add any data the alogrithm feels is relevant and may improve your model such as seasonality, trends, holidays, etc.

                        The forecast is then displayed in a plot, along with the original data.
                        You can download the forecast as a CSV file for further analysis.
                        None of your data is stored or shared with anyone. As soon as we recieve your data, we annonymise it and generate a forecast.
                        We recommend for your peace of mind that you anonymise your data before uploading it to this app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The easiest way to anonymise your data is to divide your numerical columns by the maximum value in that column.
                        This will ensure that all values are between 0 and 1, which is a standard range for forecasting 
                        and wont affect the accuracy of the model, while still anonymising your data.
                        Then, when you recieve your forecast, you can multiply each value by the maximum value you divided by at first to get the original value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A forecasting model is only as good as the data it is trained on. 
                        If you would like to improve the accuracy of your forecasts, the easiest things to do are 
                        to clean the data you provide, make sure it is as correct as possible and to provide more relevant data.
                        In terms of measuring the accuracy of your forecast, as seen on the final page it is essential to compare it to a baseline forecast.
                        I have provided some common baseline accuracy measures but feel free to use your own heuristics and metrics to compare. 
                        In other words, compare it to what you think would have been sold in the future, 
                        note it down somewhere and compare it to the model accuracy over a period of time.

                    Hi, My name is Vidul Khanna and I'm a data scientist currently working on Forecasting & other Data stuff at a Unicorn in 
                    Bangalore, India. When Learning about Forecasting, there is alot of information out there, but I found it difficult to find a 
                    simple and easy to use tool that would allow me to generate forecasts quickly and easily. 
                    This app is designed to help you generate time series forecasts quickly and easily.

                    If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
                    My email address is <a href="mailto:forecasting@data.dev">forecasting@data.dev</a>.

            <!-- Support Me Tab -->
